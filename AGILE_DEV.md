## Agile
Agile is a set of **methods and methodologies** that are optimized to help with specific problems that software teams run into, and kept simple so they’re relatively straightforward to implement. These methods and methodologies address all of the areas of traditional software engineering, including project management, software design and architecture, and process improvement. Each of those methods and methodologies consists of **practices** that are streamlined and optimized to make them as easy as possible to adopt, and comeswith a set of **values** to help the team get into the most effective mindset.

Agile is also a **mindset**, and that’s a new idea for a lot of people who haven’t worked with agile before. It turns out that each team member’s attitude toward the practices they use can make a huge difference in how effective those practices are. The agile mindset is focused on helping people share information with each other, which makes it much easier for them to make important project decisions (rather than just relying on a boss or project manager to make those decisions). It’s about opening up planning, design, and process improvement to the entire team.
