## Agile
Agile is a set of **methods and methodologies** that are optimized to help with specific problems that software teams run into, and kept simple so they’re relatively straightforward to implement. These methods and methodologies address all of the areas of traditional software engineering, including project management, software design and architecture, and process improvement. Each of those methods and methodologies consists of **practices** that are streamlined and optimized to make them as easy as possible to adopt, and comeswith a set of **values** to help the team get into the most effective mindset.

Agile is also a **mindset**, and that’s a new idea for a lot of people who haven’t worked with agile before. It turns out that each team member’s attitude toward the practices they use can make a huge difference in how effective those practices are. The agile mindset is focused on helping people share information with each other, which makes it much easier for them to make important project decisions (rather than just relying on a boss or project manager to make those decisions). It’s about opening up planning, design, and process improvement to the entire team.

<h2>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h2>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing</p>
<p>software by doing it and helping others do it.</p>
<p>Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<br />
<p><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools</p>
<p><b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation</p>
<p><b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation</p>
<p><b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan</p>
<br />
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on</p>
<p>the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

  <h2>Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto</h2>
  <i>We follow these principles:</i>
</div>

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity-—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—-is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
